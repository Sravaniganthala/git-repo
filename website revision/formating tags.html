        Film journalist Subha J Rao noted that she brings "freshness" on screen and added, "Sai Pallavi comes across as someone unafraid to flaunt her unconventional looks, offbeat film choices and lack of pretence."[61] Rediff.com placed her second in its "Top 5 Malayalam Actresses" list of 2016, with Vijay George stating that she "stole everyone’s hearts" in Premam.[62] In 2020, Pallavi became the only actress to feature in Forbes India's 30 under 30 list.[63] She stood at the 20th place in its most influential stars on Instagram in South cinema for the year 2021 list.[64]

        Pallavi has once rejected a whopping ₹2 crore endorsement deal for a fairness cream brand. She cited her disapproval of the message fairness creams promote and her own preference for natural beauty as reasons for declining the offer.
